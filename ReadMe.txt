Welcome to Group 6's Company Data Gathering Bot

This semi-automated process requires an input list of companies and outputs each companies office address, company number, NZBN, DUNs number, 
annual revenue and number of employees. Along with an error report, the outputs will be in two new seperate sheets in the same input excel file.

All you need is the "Scenario_1_companies_list.xlsx" excel file with a list of names of the targeted companies in the first column.
The excel file needs to be in the same folder as the 'main.xaml' file of this process. Ensure the excel file is closed when you run the bot.

Open the 'main.xaml' file, hit run(ctrl + F5) and you're good to go.
